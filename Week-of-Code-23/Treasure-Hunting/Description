Sam is a young treasure hunter located at point  and wants to get to the amazing treasure at point .

He has a weird machine that can transport him from some point  to point , where  is a direction vector and  is a real number called a tangent coefficient. Let  be the vector orthogonal to which has the same length and lies counter-clockwise from ; Sam can then also move from point  to point , where  is a real number called a normal coefficient.

Given , , , and , find the values of  and  for Sam's journey from point  to point  using the weird machine. Then print the value of  on a new line and the value of  on the subsequent line.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  and . 
The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  and .

Constraints

Output Format

Find two real numbers,  and , such that . Then print  as your first line of output and  as your second line of output. Your answer is considered to be correct if its absolute error is .
