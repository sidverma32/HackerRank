Alex is preparing for a programming contest and decides the gears turning in his head are at war with his own laziness. 
He imagines "n" chains of  circularly linked gears trying to turn in his head, and wonders under which circumstances 
they might be able to turn together in a single chain and when they might be locked (i.e., unable to rotate together).

Alex decides to set a problem for himself by creating "q" queries where each query takes the form of an integer, , denoting some number of circularly linked gears. For each query, print Yes on a new line if the gears can turn together; otherwise, print No.

Input Format

The first line contains single integer,"q" , denoting the number of queries. 
Each line "i" of the "q" subsequent lines contains a single integer,"n" , denoting the number of gears for that query.

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print Yes on a new line if it is possible to rotate all  gears simultaneously; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input

2
3
4
Sample Output

No
Yes
Explanation

When , the gears will lock together and be unable to rotate simulatanously so we print No on a new line. 
When , each individual gear will be able to simultaneously rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise so we print Yes on a new
