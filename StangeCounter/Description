Bob has a strange counter. At the first second,t=1 , it displays the number 3 .
At each subsequent second, the number displayed by the counter decrements by 1 .

The counter counts down in cycles. In the second after the counter counts down to 1 , 
the number becomes 2 X the initial number for that countdown cycle and then continues counting down 
from the new initial number in a new cycle. The diagram below shows the counter values for each time  
 t in the first three cycles:
 
 Given a time, t , find and print the value displayed by the counter at time .
